A fun general purpose Discord bot. Built using the great tools provided by Discord.js and Commando, Buddy can help you moderate, entertain, inform, and organize your discord server with his unique personality, and plethora of mostly useful commands. 

Key Features Include:

<h2>Starboard</h2><p> A place for special messages that need to be saved for posterity. Users who get 'stared' also receive karma, encouraging friendly interactions and competition. </p>

<h2>Karma system</h2><p> A reaction based karma system, complete with dumb things to spend the points on! Has a leaderboard for point leaders, with user  able to vote on messages with the up arrow and down arrow reaction emojis. Users also get karma per message, and tons of it when they get a post 'stared'.  </p>

<h2>Full Suite of Moderation tools</h2><p>Buddy can kick, ban, mute, and warn people, with auto moderation coming soon!</p>

<h2>Dedicated 1 Man Dev Team</h2><p>I'm always updating Buddy with new commands, new functionality, and new ways to personalize your buddy. I've been working on this bot for just about a year now, so you can take solice in the fact that I'm here to make changes or patches. No abondware here!</p>

<h2>Reddit Watcher Integration</h2><p>Buddy can watch for certain events to happen on reddit, mainly used a patch warning tool for the game Dota 2, with other games/events being worked on all the time, with patch alerts from /r/ApexLegends almost there. If you want certain subreddits/users posting alerts, they'll need to be implemented by me manually, so let me know if you have any suggestions!  </p>

<h2>Dota 2 integrations</h2><p>Buddy has the ability to search for pro teams, giving users up to date stats, DPC points, roster, and more. Buddy can also show users stats from their previous games when they add their dota ID to buddy. Buddy can also provide basic information on heros and items. Also has an inhouse command, for russlin up 10 people to play games!</p>


<h3>Dumb meme shit</h3><p> Comes standard with every buddy bot!</p>
